      <h6> "As a journalist, playwright and novelist, I travel in circles with creative people from all over the world. One of my college classmates went on to become executive producer of the hit TV show “Cheers.” One of my former co-workers went on to write best-sellers on opioids and globalization. I have other friends who have written screenplays in Hollywood, hit plays in New York, and Top 10 pop hits in Canada. All these are dazzlingly creative people in their own way. I have no hesitation in saying that Sammy Sylvester is every bit as creative as them in her chosen fields."</h6>
